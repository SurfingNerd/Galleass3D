    i went back and forth for a while trying to decide if you send the fillet to the village
    then, this contract pulls from there. It's really cool to see the village contract "inventory"
    BUT, if there is a contract for every village then it would need to be deployed as a new one is built
    this deployment would have to come from the builder and you would have to trust it...
    ...maybe that is okay? Maybe the bytecode could be compared or something...
    ..I think I've decided against that, I think it makes more sense to have one contract for all of the villages.
