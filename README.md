For the Ethereal  Hackaton 2019 i decided to remake the game in Unity3D, using Nethereum as connector to a private, specialized blockchain.

### Unity

Unity 2019.3.13f1 has been used on Ubuntu 18.04 for development.
In order to get Nethereum completly supporte .Net 4.x as scripting backend is beeing used.

Unfortuonatly the project wont run within a Web Browser (JS/WebAssembly/OpenGL Build) because of the heavy use of async functions. Maybe the Unity Dev Team manage to make this magic happen in the future.

###  truffle
